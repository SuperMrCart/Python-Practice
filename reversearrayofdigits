Convert number to reversed array of digits
Given a random number:

C#: long;
C++: unsigned long;
You have to return the digits of this number within an array in reverse order.

def digitize(n):
    e = [int(i) for i in str(n)] #using list comprehension to change the int we recieve into a list.
    e.reverse() #using python's built in list commands to reverse the list we recieve and return it.
    return e
