We need a function that can transform a number into a string.

What ways of achieving this do you know?

#using the str function built into python made to convert ints to strings.

def number_to_string(num):
    x = str(num) #wanted intiate a variable.
    return x


#me realizing i really didnt need to initate a varible to print out when i could just return it raw.

def number_to_string(num):
     return str(num)
