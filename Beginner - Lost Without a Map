#Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.

For example:

[1, 2, 3] --> [2, 4, 6]

For the beginner, try to use the map method - it comes in very handy quite a lot so is a good one to know.#

def doublelist(a):
    result = 1
    for x in a:
        result = result * x
    return result
    
number = [1,2,3,4]
print(doublelist(number))
    using transvere policy to move through all the indexes and double them.
    
using numpy


##solving using numpy
import numpy

number = [1,2,3,4]
result = numpy.prod(number)
print(result)
